# Rules for how to work

* Team mates must be available for questions and help
* Must try to be on stand-up meetings
* All communication will be done through discord
* Must work in branches, never directly on master
  * Branches must be named after their issue number Ex: TRAPI-###
* Commits must be done often
* Commit messages should be descriptive and should start with @Username
* Keep the group informed if you will be absent
* If the person realize that he/she needs to add more issues to implement feature they are working on, the issues needs to be discussed with the group before the person creates and add the issue to the sprint/backlog



# Rules for committing code

* Code must be merged through pull request
* Code must be reviewed before merging to master
* Never EVER commit code directly to master!!!
* Everyone present during review must approve pull request before they are merged

# Panic situations

* In situations where the person / group feels that the project is stationary or has major problems that cannot be solved by themselves, the group is called to a meeting to revise the work process and the project on how and what needs to be changed to continue with the work to achieve the projects goals.
