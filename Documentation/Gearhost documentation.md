Gearhost documentation

We used Gearhost for our database (http://www.gearhost.com)

- Use Gearhost settings to connect db to Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
- Connectionsettings are stored in appsettings.json
- A backup of  database has been done via gearhost of initial data, made 2020-05-11.
  - Can probably restore database in Management Studio (havent tested).
  - Backup is stored in git:     /Documentation/DBBackup

- If you need another backup, contact Micael Wollter or if you manage to do it via Management Studio by yourself.
- No seeding have been done, we manually inputed data via Management Studio.
- If you need to change/reset password to database, contact Micael Wollter, since the database used are tied to account (separate db password and username for database ofc).
